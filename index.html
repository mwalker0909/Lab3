        <h1>Some things I've done!</h1>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li class ="one">Graduated High School in 2010</li>
                <li class ="two">Attended College for two years </li>
                <li class ="three">Moved to washington for work in 2012</li>
                <li class ="four">Started working at my first tech company in 2014 (And hated it!)</li>
                <li class ="five">Moved back to Oregon in summer 2015 to start work in the real estate field</li>
                <li class ="six">Jumped around jobs and eventually moved to Bend 2016</li>
                <li class ="seven">I've spend my last few years teaching / coaching here in Bend</li>
                <li class ="paragraph">As you can see, I have spent a considerable amount of time trying to figure out what I would like to complete in life.
        I have so many different thoughts, dreams, and ideas that sometimes I overload myself. Luckily with Software Development, 
        I think I'll be able to sit and focus as I look towards the future! In the next ten years, I hope to be an accomplished developer working 
        for a local company here in Central Oregon. I'm certain that if I put the time and effort into obtaining this skill, the rest of my desires
        will fall into place. </li>
